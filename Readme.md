# VirtualBox Ruby Gem

The VirtualBox ruby gem is a library which allows anyone to control VirtualBox 
from ruby code! Create, destroy, start, stop, suspend, and resume virtual machines.
Also list virtual machines, list hard drives, network devices, etc.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to VirtualBox, the first step to developing is to
clone this repo, get [wycat's bundler](http://github.com/wycats/bundler) if you
don't have it already, and do the following:

    gem bundle test
    rake

This will run the test suite, which should come back all green! Then you're good to go!
